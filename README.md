# Real-Time Vehicle Monitoring System

## Overview

This project is designed to develop a real-time streaming system for monitoring and analyzing data from a simulated vehicle journey between Central London and Birmingham. The system leverages self-generated data to mimic real-world conditions, including GPS location, weather data, and emergency alerts. The primary objective is to process and analyze this data in real-time, enabling timely insights and responses during the simulated journey.

The architecture is designed to ensure seamless data generation, ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis. Below is a detailed breakdown of the components involved:

### 1. Data Collection

The data in this project is self-generated using Python code that simulates a vehicle's journey between Central London and Birmingham. The following steps describe how this data is generated:

- **Location Simulation:** 
  - The vehicle's journey is simulated using predefined coordinates for London and Birmingham.
  - **Latitude and Longitude Increments:** The movement from London to Birmingham is broken down into increments, with slight random variations added to simulate a more realistic path.
  - **Vehicle Movement:** Each new data point reflects the vehicle's gradual movement along this path, with randomized adjustments to latitude and longitude.

- **Time Simulation:** 
  - The timestamps for data points are generated by incrementing the start time by random intervals between 30 and 60 seconds, simulating real-time data collection.

- **Vehicle Data Generation:** 
  - The system generates data points that include vehicle details such as speed, direction, make, model, and fuel type, in addition to the location and timestamp.

### 2. Data Ingestion and Processing

Once the data is generated, it is ingested and processed using the following components:

- **Apache Kafka:** A messaging queue that manages the simulated data streams.
  - **Kafka Topics:** The generated data is published to Kafka topics such as `vehicle_data`, `gps_data`, `traffic_data`, `weather_data`, and `emergency_data`.
- **Apache Spark:** Consumes Kafka streams and processes the data in real-time. Spark analyzes the data, detecting simulated events like traffic delays or emergencies, and then streams the processed data to an AWS S3 bucket.

### 3. Data Storage and Analysis in AWS

The processed data is stored and analyzed in the AWS cloud environment:

- **AWS S3:** Stores the processed data streams from Spark.
- **AWS Glue:** Automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, transforming the data in S3 and cataloging it.
- **AWS Data Catalog:** Organizes and categorizes the processed data for easy access.
- **Amazon Athena/Redshift:** Enables querying and analyzing the data, generating insights and reports on the simulated vehicle journey.
